With years of experience in website and software design, we’re experts in facilitating design sessions.

Pulling together stakeholders, developers and end users, we help identify business and user needs, prioritise them and resolve conflicts, and use scenario-based design to produce rapid design directions.

We’ve run workshops for small and large businesses and government agencies.

Whether it’s a one-day design session, or a multi-month process, we can help you along the path towards better products and services.
