Our philosophy is to support clients who want to become customer-focused.

By using a mentoring model, we help clients make strategic decisions about what user research may be required, how to conduct the research and apply it to design, and how and when to conduct evaluations or testing.

We help up-skill staff by supporing them in conducting activities such as site visits, participatory design and wireframing. By working with an experienced pracitioner, staff gain the confidence and experience to conduct the activities themselves.

The mentoring model can minimse the extent to which companies need to rely on external consultants, and enable them to become more customer-focused.
