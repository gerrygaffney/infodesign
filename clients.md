We’ve worked with dozens of clients on hundreds of projects since 1991. For many clients, we’ve conducted multiple projects.

DEC logo
We helped Dept of Education and Communites with a range of projects

Julian Huxham, Progrqam Manager, said: “Gerry [Gaffney] managed to excel in providing logical outcomes that enhanced the business value proposition whilst meeting the accessibility and user requirements. Quite simply – he listens exceptionally well.”

John Holland logo
Engineering company John Holland wanted to know more about how their staff managed their information.

We helped them conduct a series of on-site interviews and observations to see how engineers and administrators worked and accessed information when planning, costing and executing often very large projects in diverse industries.

We also helped them review the pilot implementation of new technology, and suggested ways that they could leverage the benefits and address the issues.

Dan Raica, Lead Design Analyst, said: “Gerry Gaffney’s direct engagement with our users provided us with a true insight into how systems and information were utilised at John Holland. His research, analysis and designs provided our new Intranet and collaboration tools with a clear pathway to ensuring our people will always interact with relevant and usable information that meets their needs.”

ANZ logo
We helped ANZ bank to get a better understanding of internet banking users, and to translate those requirements into strategic future directions.

We ran custom-designed training for their intranet developers to help them focus on their users.

We conducted usability reviews and usability testing for several internal and customer-facing applications.

Steve Pick, Practise Lead, Interaction Desgin, said: “Gerry [Gaffney] is a pleasure to work with, his work is excellent, his knowledge encyclopaedic…”

LinkMe logo
LinkMe knew they needed a deeper knowledge of job hunters.

We helped them conduct a diary study (“cultural probe”), and combined the results with existing data to create personas and scenarios that could be used to define design priorities and directions.

We also helped them produce and document their information architecture, and introduced them to the joys of d-i-y usability testing.

Paul Tyrrell, Development Manager, said: “InfoDesign brought about a culture shift in our company towards user centered design, allowing us to beat our competitors in terms of ease of use and member engagement.”

ACMI logo
When ACMI (the Australian Centre for the Moving Image) was founded, we helped specify and design their corporate website. We undertook user and business needs analyses, conducted design sessions, developed wireframes and information architecture, and usability tested the site through prototype stages prior to release.

We also usability tested their movie booths.

Carolyn Guerin from ACMI said that: “Information and Design has helped us to focus our design efforts on the needs of our users.”

Telstra logo
We’ve helped this major telco in a wide range of projects, including call centre programs, and web-based customer applications such as online billing. We’ve reviewed or tested mobile and web-based content, as well as reviewing paper and online forms. We’ve worked with engineers, technicians, sales and marketing staff, as well as customers.

Privacy Victoria logo
We conducted reviews and usability tests for Privacy Victoria’s website. We also reviewed and tested the paper form used by citizens to lodge complaints about breaches of privacy.

More recently, we helped design and evaluate the online form for their survey of the use of portable storage devices.

As the report states: “The decision to make the survey an online application had data quality and efficiency benefits, but required careful up front survey construction. The survey was subjected to intensive usability testing to optimise ease of use, and thus minimise the need for Help Desk support. Information & Design Pty Ltd was contracted to guide survey development and undertake the usability testing.”

Other clients have included the Coles group, Wishlist, Department of Natural Resources & Environment, CIN, Holden, Komapss, MDG, NEMMCO, Nissan, Neslon Thomson Learning, University of Melbourne, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT), Victorian Managed Insurance Agency (VMIA), Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Authority (ARPANSA), the Curriculum Corporation, Lutheran Community Care, B&R Enclosures, and Monash University.

With our colleagues in Apogee – Usability in Asia we’ve worked for Marriott hotels, PCCW, South China Morning Post, HSBC and others.
