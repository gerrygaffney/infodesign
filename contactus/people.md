He has always had a keen interest in ‘do-it-yourself’ usability, and is a firm believer that organisations can, and should, take control of the design process.

He has spoken on UX and related topics around the world.

He is Director of Publications at UXPA (User Experience Professionals Association), and a former managing editor of its User Experience magazine.

Gerry is passionate about the need to improve the quality of the relationship between humans and the products we use.
